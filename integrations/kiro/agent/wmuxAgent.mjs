// The Kiro agent config that carries wmux's hooks.
//
// Kiro's hooks can only live inside an agent config — there is no global hooks
// directory (measured: `~/.kiro/hooks/` is inert on 2.15.1) and no config-dir
// environment variable to redirect. The user's default agent is BUILT IN, so
// there is no file of theirs to add a hook to. wmux therefore ships its OWN
// agent and panes opt in with `kiro-cli chat --agent wmux`; nothing the user
// owns is ever written, and their default agent stays their default.
//
// THE RULE: equivalent to `kiro_default` except the prompt.
//
// Values below were read from a materialized built-in
// (`kiro-cli agent create --from kiro_default`) on 2.15.1:
//
//   tools ["*"]  allowedTools []  toolAliases {}  toolsSettings {}
//   mcpServers {}  model null  includeMcpJson true  prompt 1696 bytes
//   resources [AmazonQ.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, skills×2, steering]
//
// `allowedTools: []` is why approval behaviour cannot change: the built-in
// pre-approves nothing either, so omitting the key is not more restrictive.
//
// Two fields are NOT free to omit, and an earlier revision omitted both:
//   - `includeMcpJson` — without it the agent loads no MCP servers, so a
//     wmux-launched Kiro pane cannot reach wmux's own MCP tools.
//   - `resources` — without it AGENTS.md, README.md, skills and steering docs
//     stop being auto-loaded and the agent quietly loses project context.
// The measurement that cleared the empty prompt ran a synthetic task in a temp
// directory, where neither could have shown up. Hence `_kiro-equivalence.mjs`,
// which diffs this against the live built-in.
//
// The empty prompt IS deliberate. Measured 3x on the same tool-using task:
// thin and built-in both 3/3 correct, 17.4s vs 18.0s, thin slightly cheaper.
// Cloning the 1.7KB built-in prompt would freeze it at install time and drift
// as Kiro updates its own.
