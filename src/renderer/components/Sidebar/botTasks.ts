// ─── Bot workers live on the Bots page (2026-10-13, 2026-10-14) ────────────
//
// A fan-out task a factory bot dispatched is the bot's worker, not the
// owner's own work: it is shown on the Bots page, under the bot that started
// it, and nowhere else. The Workspaces sidebar, its collapsed rail form, the
// Ctrl+N digits, the Tasks line and Fleet (its board, its counts, the rail
// and status-bar badges) leave it out, and the "Workspaces N" header never
// counts it — the workspace the owner is in included (owner decision
// 2026-10-14: a bot's worker opens inside the Bots page).
//
// Which bot owns a task workspace: its lineage origin (`{kind:'bot', botId}`,
// `fanoutOrigin`). After a restart main answers it from the task ledger's
// dispatch record when the lineage stamp lacks it (FANOUT_LINEAGE), so the
// worker stays told apart.
