// ─── A bot's saved workflow, as one card in its conversation (pure) ──────
//
// A workflow (shared/botWorkflow.ts) is a bot's plan of up to eight code
// steps, one worker each; a step's verified result (a passing system gate
// on a commit, or a merged pull request) lets the next one start. The owner
// reads it as one card in the conversation it was saved from, at the time
// it was saved: its state, the step it is on, why it stopped in plain
// words, and the last verified result (which step, what was verified, and
// when). Cancel (the owner IPC) stops the steps not yet started; a step
// already running keeps its worker. This module derives the card's view and
// places it; BotsWorkflowCard.tsx draws it.
