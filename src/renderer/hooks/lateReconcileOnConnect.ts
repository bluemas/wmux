/**
 * Late-reconcile trigger for `daemon:connected`.
 *
 * Extracted from AppLayout's inline listener as a pure, dependency-injected
 * factory (no zustand / electron import) so the gating decision can be
 * unit-tested in isolation — mirroring reconcileWithReQuery.ts.
 *
 * Two layers of protection live here:
 *
 * 1. paneGate gate (S-A Step 1). With the renderer now loading in parallel
 *    with the daemon bootstrap, the INITIAL daemon:connected can arrive
 *    while the startup reconcile is still pending (under the old serialized
 *    boot it was emitted before this listener existed and was simply lost).
 *    The startup path owns that first reconcile — it is serialized behind
 *    daemon.whenReady() and flips paneGate when done. This listener is
 *    strictly for LATE connects (respawn/reconnect), so it bails while the
 *    gate is still pending.
 *
 *    Skipping is information-lossless only because a daemon respawn cannot
 *    complete inside the startup window: DaemonRespawnController enforces a
 *    ≥1 s minimum backoff, far longer than the pty.list → gate-flip gap, so
 *    a skipped connect during startup is always the INITIAL connect whose
 *    state the startup reconcile is about to read anyway. If that backoff
 *    floor is ever tuned below the reconcile gap, revisit this gate.
 *
 * 2. RCA A1/A3 guards. The late reconcile previously ran as a bare
 *    reconcilePtys() with NO abort, timeout, or catch (unlike the startup
 *    path's 5 guards). A pty.list rejection escaped as an unhandled
 *    rejection, and the call could outlive a fresher reconcile. Failures
 *    are swallowed by PRESERVING ptyIds — never fall through to
 *    clearAllPtyState here (that destructive fallback is startup-only).
