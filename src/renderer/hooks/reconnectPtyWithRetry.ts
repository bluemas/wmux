/**
 * RCA A1 — reconnect a live daemon session with retry, distinguishing
 * transient from permanent failure.
 *
 * Extracted from useTerminal so the policy can be unit-tested in isolation
 * (no xterm / zustand / electron import needed). Dependencies are injected.
 *
 * The pre-fix code called `pty.reconnect(ptyId)` once and, on ANY failure,
 * immediately cleared the surface's ptyId — making Terminal self-create a
 * fresh empty session. That conflated two very different situations:
 *
 *   - permanent (transient:false): the daemon reports the session genuinely
 *     dead → clearing is correct (the next mount self-creates).
 *   - transient (transient:true / unknown): the session is alive but the
 *     freshly-attached pipe is not writable yet, or the RPC threw during a
 *     main-side handler-swap window → clearing here DESTROYS a live session.
 *     This is the reported "daemon reset, session replaced" bug.
 *
 * We retry transient failures with short backoff. Only a permanent answer
 * clears; exhausted retries keep the id unconfirmed (#2398). `isCurrent()`
 * lets the caller bail the moment the terminal unmounts so we never mutate
 * state for a torn-down view.
