// The batched form of `task.mission.list` (shared/missionListBatch.ts has the
// wire contract and why it exists). Kept out of daemon/index.ts so the authz
// and per-owner rules are testable without the daemon.
//
// Identity: the single form trusts a pre-stamped `verifiedWorkspaceId`
// verbatim (stampChannelCaller rule 1, the documented #113 same-user ceiling),
// and its producers are main's own reads and main's pipe router. The batch
// applies the same rule to every id. The boundary is main's router, which
// takes a batch from the operator alone. A request that also carries a
// `senderPtyId` names a pane caller, which the single form would scope to its
// own workspace, so it is refused whole (BATCH_NOT_ALLOWED) rather than
// answered for other owners. That keeps the daemon consistent with the
// router; it is not a boundary of its own, since a client on the daemon pipe
// can name any owner with the single form anyway (the #113 ceiling).
