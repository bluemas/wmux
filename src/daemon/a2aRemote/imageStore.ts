// ─── Image files of cross-PC A2A messages (`images.1`) ─────────────────────
//
// Four folders, each owned by this store, 0700, files 0600, written to a
// temp name with `wx` and renamed into place:
//
//   <wmuxDir>/uploads/a2a/<hostId>/<sha256>.<ext>  images received from that
//       PC: what the receiving agent reads by path. Content-addressed, so a
//       message received twice writes nothing new (the file's time is
//       refreshed instead). Kept A2A_IMAGE_RETAIN_MS by mtime.
//   <wmuxDir>/uploads/a2a/local/<sha256>.<ext>  images an agent on THIS PC
//       sent to another pane here (a2a.attachments.stage), same retention.
//   <wmuxDir>/a2a/blobs/<sha256>  the sender's copy of what it queued for
//       another PC: the bytes the envelope's hash names, kept while a ledger
//       message still refers to them (the outbound sync may rebuild an
//       envelope from the ledger at any time), served to a joiner by GET.
//   <wmuxDir>/a2a/blobs-in/<hostId>/<sha256>  bytes a joiner uploaded (PUT)
//       ahead of the envelope that names them. Moved into the received
//       folder once that envelope passes the link checks; dropped when the
//       envelope is refused for good, when the peer's share is full (its own
//       oldest go first) and after STAGING_TTL_MS.
//
// The `uploads/a2a` folder is inside `~/.wmux/uploads`, the folder
// `browser_file_upload` already allows, as the phone's photos are. Nothing in
// these folders is ever opened, decoded or run by wmux; an extension comes
// from the sniffed bytes only and no name from a peer ever reaches a path.
// The sweeps match only the names this store writes.
//
// Quotas: one PC's received folder holds at most RECEIVED_HOST_MAX_FILES /
// RECEIVED_HOST_MAX_BYTES, all of `uploads/a2a` at most
// RECEIVED_TOTAL_MAX_BYTES. A full store refuses (the image is reported as
// not received); it never evicts a received image. Paired PCs can fill the
// total between them: it is bounded, and the retention frees it.
