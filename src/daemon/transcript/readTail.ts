// Bounded, crash-proof reads of a Claude Code transcript `.jsonl`.
//
// The discipline here is carried over verbatim from
// `src/main/claude/lastAssistantMessage.ts`, because every one of its rules was
// paid for:
//
//   - `lstatSync` + `st.isFile()` BEFORE `openSync`. `transcriptPath` arrives
//     from a hook payload, and `openSync` on a FIFO blocks the process
//     indefinitely — there is no timeout to save us and no way to cancel a
//     blocked syscall. In the daemon that would stall every pane at once.
//   - `readSync` into a right-sized buffer, then `buf.subarray(0, read)`.
//     Decoding the whole buffer would leave zero-fill in the tail when the file
//     is truncated or rotated mid-read, corrupting the very last record.
//   - a partial leading line is EXPECTED on any mid-file seek; it is dropped,
//     not repaired.
//   - every failure resolves to `null`. A transcript that was rotated, deleted,
//     or written by an agent whose format we do not know must degrade to "Chat
//     View unavailable", never to a daemon-side throw.
//
// Reads are bounded at TAIL_BYTES so a multi-megabyte transcript costs the same
// as a small one, and so a subscribe storm cannot turn into unbounded IO.
