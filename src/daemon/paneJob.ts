/**
 * #2398 — the pane shells a daemon started die with it.
 *
 * Nothing tied a pane's process tree to the daemon's lifetime, so a daemon that
 * crashed or was force-killed left every pane shell running (and the wsl.exe
 * of every WSL pane). Each crash made the next start worse: the next daemon
 * spawns a fresh set while the orphans keep their memory.
 *
 * One Job Object per daemon, with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE | BREAKAWAY_OK. The daemon
 * holds its only handle (not inheritable, never duplicated), so when the daemon
 * dies for any reason the job closes and Windows ends every process in it.
 *
 * The daemon joins the job itself at startup, before it spawns anything
 * (enter()). Every process it creates from then on is in the job from
 * CreateProcess, and so is everything those start. Assigning each shell after
 * the spawn instead left a gap: node-pty 1.2.0-beta creates the shell inside
 * conptyNative.connect(), once the conout worker is ready, and reports its pid
 * only after the output pipe connects an I/O turn later; anything the shell
 * started before the daemon's contain() ran was never in the job, since
 * AssignProcessToJobObject does not take a process's existing children.
 *
 * So the job holds more than pane shells: the conhost/OpenConsole of each
 * pseudoconsole, chat agents, git and gh helpers, probes. They end with a
 * crashed daemon too, which is what an orphan of a dead daemon would have
 * been anyway. A program that must outlive wmux asks to leave with
 * CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB, which BREAKAWAY_OK allows: the shared Codex
 * app-server that `codex app-server daemon start` launches does exactly that
 * (observed with codex 0.162.1), so it keeps serving other clients.
 *
 * A clean exit (quit, update, B′ replacement) disarms the job the moment it
 * decides to exit, before any shutdown phase that a caller's kill budget could
 * cut short: it clears KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, so programs started from a pane on
 * purpose (`start`, a background server) survive it as they always have.
 * Owner decision on #2398 (§6-11): they die only when the daemon crashes or is
 * force-killed.
 *
 * Where the daemon cannot join (an outer job that refuses nesting, a native
 * call that throws), each node-pty pane shell is assigned once it is spawned
 * (contain()), the gap above included. Which process a pid names is checked
 * before it is assigned. node-pty closes its handle on the shell as soon as
 * the shell exits, so a shell that exits at once can free its pid before the
 * session registers, and the pid can then name another process. The job opens
 * the pid and, through that one handle (which pins the process, so the pid
 * cannot change hands meanwhile), requires the process to be the daemon's own
 * child created no earlier than the spawn began: the parent pid from
 * NtQueryInformationProcess, the creation time from GetProcessTimes. Nothing is
 * looked up by pid again and no process snapshot is taken, so a recovery burst
 * of panes costs a few syscalls each. Observed on Windows 11 with node-pty
 * 1.2.0-beta.15, for the in-box ConPTY and the bundled conpty.dll alike: the
 * shell's parent is the daemon (CreateProcess runs in the daemon), and
 * conhost.exe/OpenConsole.exe is its sibling, not its parent. The creation time
 * rules out a process that still names our pid as its parent from before this
 * daemon owned that pid (Windows never re-parents an orphan).
 *
 * Limits of what it guarantees:
 * - A WSL pane's wsl.exe is contained, but not wslhost.exe: that one is a
 *   child of wslservice.exe, not of the pane. The Linux side ends when the
 *   wsl.exe relay closes.
 * - BREAKAWAY_OK lets a program that asks for CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB leave;
 *   without it such a program would fail to start at all.
 * - Per pane only: OpenConsole/conhost are started by CreatePseudoConsole
 *   before the shell exists, so they stay outside (they exit when the daemon's
 *   pseudoconsole handles close), and a shell that cannot be opened,
 *   identified or assigned (an elevated process, one already in a job that
 *   refuses nesting) stays uncontained, as before; the create never fails
 *   over it. A native call that throws turns the job off for the daemon's life
 *   instead of failing the create.
 * The Rust backend puts each pane in its own kill-on-close job already
 * (psuedocon.rs). Inside a joined daemon that job nests under this one; per
 * pane, the two cannot be mixed, so its panes are skipped by the caller.
