// request within PHONE_ATTACH_WINDOW_MS. The same two halves as the roster's
// "Active now" (deviceActivity.ts), with a longer window: a phone between
// streams (backgrounded, then reopened) is still the person working with
// this computer. A stream that stays open on a half-open socket (the phone
// left the network) counts until the heartbeat write fails.
//
// Nothing polls. Every event that can change the answer (a stream opening
// or closing, a request, a revoke, the server stopping) calls update(), and
// one timer is armed for the moment the earliest request window ends.
