 * The terminal brain types each turn as one paste — the context blocks main
 * builds (rules, policy, decision, active work) with the prompt at the end —
 * so Claude records the whole wire as the user's message, capped by the
 * parser. Shown as-is, the chat would display Moa's instructions as if the
 * operator had typed them. Main knows what was actually asked, so such an
 * entry is shown as the prompt main sent for it:
 *  - an entry that ends with a prompt is that prompt's (a wire typed into a
 *    TUI that is still starting can lose its paste markers and its start);
 *  - else a pasted entry takes the latest prompt noted before it, within
 *    PROMPT_MATCH_WINDOW_MS. Never a prompt noted after it.
 * Each prompt is used once, and `assigned` remembers which entry took which
 * prompt across calls (snapshots and appends see the same entries again).
 * A prompt is known by its time and text, not its object, so a caller that
 * re-reads the prompts from disk on every call still uses each one once.
