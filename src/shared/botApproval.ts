// ─── Owner approvals — irreversible and public acts a bot asks for ─────────
//
// Contract for main/factory/approvals.ts, the merge executor ports, the
// approval card and Settings › Bots rules list). A bot never performs an
// irreversible or public act itself, and its workers are refused one
// (botWorkerGuard.ts): it asks with `approval_request` (BOT_APPROVAL_RPC),
// main writes the request record — reading the PR head, the gh login and the
// thread itself, never from params — and posts an `approval` card
// (shared/room.ts) with Approve / Deny / Always allow.
//
// The grant is written only by main, from the main window (the card buttons,
// the composer's "Approve N pending" chip — BOT_APPROVAL_IPC, sender-checked)
// or the phone's operator route. No bot RPC approves anything. An owner
// message also approves, main deciding: a human-authored card in the same
// thread, posted after the pending request cards, short, matching
// isOwnerApprovalText, approves that thread's pending requests shown above
// it. An approved merge waits APPROVAL_UNDO_MS with Undo on the card, then
// becomes a MergeEffect `{approvedBy:'owner', decisionId: requestId,
// expectHead}` for the one merge executor, which re-checks at run time
// (approval still standing, head unchanged, CI not failing or pending,
// `--match-head-commit`, gh login unchanged); a moved head is refused
// `head-moved` and needs a new request.
//
// "Always allow" stores an ApprovalRule; a later request it covers is
// approved by `'rule'` only when the lane-grade predicates hold (verifier
// PASS with evidence, trusted author, not tainted) and ruleAuthorize allows
// it (factory on, the lane's daily cap; the rule is the owner's consent, so
// the lane auto-merge switch does not hold it). A rule never covers force
// push or release.
