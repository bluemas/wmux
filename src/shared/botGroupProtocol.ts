// ─── Bot group chats — reactions and round caps ────────────────────────────

// isEmoji). See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
//
// In a group chat (shared/botGroup.ts) a bot woken by the owner's message or
// by another bot's mention has three moves: speak (a card), react (end the
// turn with `[[react:👍]]` alone, or before its words) or stay silent (end
// with no card). Main turns the last two into a reaction on the card the bot
// was woken for (RoomCard.reactions): a silent bot leaves an acknowledgement,
// so it never just vanishes. A reaction is UI data on that card and nothing
// else: it writes no fact, wakes no bot and starts no handoff.
//
// A group can talk itself into a loop (A mentions B, B mentions A, …). A
// round is what follows the owner's message in the group's thread; it holds
// GROUP_ROUND_LIMITS.LINES bot cards, LINES_PER_BOT of one bot, and bot-to-
// bot mentions MENTION_WAVES deep. Past that a bot's post is refused, and so
// its mentions wake nobody: the chain ends.
