 *              shell.openExternal; wmux spawns no guest Chromium at all.
 * 'chrome'   — wmux launches the user's installed Chrome with a dedicated
 *              profile (persistent logins, separate from their daily
 *              browser) and drives it over CDP. Full automation toolset via
 *              the Playwright path; the webview RPC fallback does not apply.
 *
 * External mode is fire-and-forget by design: wmux gets no tab handle back
 * from the OS, so there is no surface, no tracking, and no deep automation.
 * Tools that need a live page fail closed with EXTERNAL_BACKEND_UNSUPPORTED
 * below — never a generic target-miss, never a silent fallback onto some
 * other builtin surface.
