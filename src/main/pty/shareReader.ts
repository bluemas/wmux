/**
 * #2407 — reads for the git watcher, off this process's fs threadpool.
 *
 * A read on a WSL share waits on the distro's 9P server. Done here, a hung one
 * holds one of libuv's four fs threads until the server answers, and no
 * deadline or cancel can free it: four hung distros would stall every fs call
 * the daemon (or main) makes. So a share's reads go to a small reader process
 * per distro, which is simply killed when a read misses its deadline and is
 * started again on the next read. A worker thread would not do: the pool is
 * per process.
 *
 * Each reader is a queue: one read at a time is handed to its process, so a
 * wedged distro parks one read, not a pile of them. A read whose caller no
 * longer wants it (the pane closed or moved on) leaves the queue at once and
 * is never handed over.
 *
 * The trade-off is head-of-line blocking within one distro: a read already
 * handed over is not killed when its caller lets go (a pane cd'ing during a
 * walk would otherwise respawn the process on every move), so the next read
 * there waits for its answer or its deadline: at most SHARE_READ_DEADLINE_MS
 * (5 s). Its answer, if one comes, is dropped. Other distros are unaffected.
