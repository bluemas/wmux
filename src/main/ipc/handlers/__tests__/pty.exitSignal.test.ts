/**
 * Source-level lock (#1838): node-pty reports a signal-killed shell as exit
 * code 0 with the signal beside it. The renderer closes a tab on a clean exit,
 * so the daemon → main → renderer exit path must carry the signal, or kill -9,
 * a crash or an OOM kill would close the tab and lose its scrollback. Both hops
 * are wired deep inside daemon and electron setup, so like the reconnect locks
 * they are pinned at the source level.
