/**
 * Schedules a workspace-profile startup command for a just-created PTY.
 *
 * Extracted from pty.handler (electron-free) so the timing logic has direct
 * unit coverage. Why it is event-driven rather than a fixed delay: the previous
 * blind 200 ms timer was racy and dropped the command intermittently. Two
 * failure modes — (1) in daemon mode `writeToSession` returns false while the
 * session pipe is still mid-attach, and a single fire-and-forget write was
 * silently dropped; (2) on a busy box the shell hadn't reached its interactive
 * prompt at 200 ms, so the keystrokes were lost.
 *
 * This helper instead:
 *   - waits for the shell's FIRST output (caller invokes `onFirstData`), which
 *     signals the shell is alive and (daemon mode) the pipe is carrying data;
 *   - then waits a short settle for the prompt to finish rendering;
 *   - then writes, RETRYING while the write reports "not delivered" (the writer
 *     returns `false`) up to a bounded budget;
 *   - falls back to firing anyway if no output ever arrives;
 *   - invokes `onExhausted` if every retry reported "not delivered", so the
 *     caller can leave a diagnostic trail instead of a silent no-run.
 *
 * The command is written exactly once (guarded), and all timers are unref'd so
 * a pending command never keeps the process alive.
