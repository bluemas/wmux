/**
 * Show a window built hidden once it has painted (#2512). Windows draws a
 * window that is shown before Chromium's first frame in the system's blank
 * colour, so the opaque window is built with `show: false` and revealed on
 * `ready-to-show`, which fires on the page's first paint (its background, not
 * its content), so the window appears no later than its first colour did.
 *
 * A page that fails to load, or a renderer that dies before it paints, still
 * reveals the window: a live app with no window could only be killed. A
 * restored maximized window is maximized (and focused) here, since maximize()
 * shows a hidden window and would reveal it before its first frame.
