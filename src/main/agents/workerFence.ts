// ─── The worker fence: the one settings file an unattended worker runs with ─
//
// An unattended claude worker (a bot preset in `bypassPermissions`, a fan-out
// worker in `auto`) runs with ONE `--settings` document that confines it to
// its worktree and its own temp folder:
//   - Claude Code's OS sandbox (Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux) for
//     Bash: writes only in the worktree, the worker's temp folder and the
//     repository's trusted test paths; the shared `.git` narrowed to what a
//     commit on the worker's own branch needs; the named credential files
//     unreadable;
//   - a PreToolUse hook (matcher `.*`) for claude's built-in file tools, which
//     run in claude's own process, outside the sandbox: a write lands only
//     inside the worktree or the temp folder (workerFenceHookScript);
//   - a permission deny on the same credential files, because the Read tool
//     does not go through the sandbox's denyRead.
// Where the sandbox cannot run (Windows, WSL, Linux without bubblewrap) the
// document carries the hook and the permission denies only, and says so
// (`weaker`).
//
// Everything here is pure: main computes the git facts and paths at launch
// and passes them in. Wiring it into a launch is the caller's job.
