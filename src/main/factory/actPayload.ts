// ─── An act's text on its approval card, and the hash an approval echoes ───
//
// A comment or a new issue publishes text a bot wrote, under the owner's
// name. Its approval card shows that text whole, and the phone shows the same
// card, so the owner approves exactly what GitHub gets:
//
//   - each bot-text field is its own CommonMark fenced block at column 0,
//     info string `wmux-payload`, in a fixed order (comment: the body with
//     wmux's marker line; issue_create: the title, then the body with the
//     marker). Text read from GitHub that gives context (a target's title)
//     is fenced with the info string `text` and is not part of the payload.
//   - a fence is a backtick run longer than any backtick or tilde run in its
//     text (and at least 3), so nothing inside can close it.
//   - payloadHash is the lowercase hex sha256 of the UTF-8 bytes of the
//     payload fences' inner texts in card order, joined by one U+0000. The
//     inner text is the lines between the fence lines joined by \n, with no
//     trailing newline: exactly the stored field, which is what main posts.
//
// The text is normalised when the bot asks (\n line ends only, no trailing
// whitespace at its end) and refused when the card could show other bytes
// than the post sends: control, bidi or zero-width characters, a stored
// secret the room would redact, or a `wmux-approval` marker of its own.
// docs/phone-client-contract.md carries the same rule for the phone.
