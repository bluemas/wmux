// ─── Factory migrations — one-shot moves of the old Moa/Deck files ─────────
//
// Run once per app start by the factory host before any module starts
// (factoryHost.ts). The version reached is recorded in
// `factory/migration.json` ({version}); the chain is walked by the shared
// engine (daemon/util/atomicWrite/migrate.ts `applyMigrations`, strict +1
// hops). The registry's current version is the number of steps, so the chain
// is empty — and running it a no-op that writes nothing — until the first step
// lands; a later step can therefore never be skipped by a marker an earlier
// build wrote.
//
// A step does its own file I/O through the context and must be idempotent: a
// crash after a step but before the marker write runs it again on the next
// start. Back up what a step deletes (quarantineFileSync / a `.premigrate`
// copy) before deleting it.
