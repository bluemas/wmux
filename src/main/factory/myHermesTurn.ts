// ─── My Hermes — what a bot on the owner's own Hermes is sent ──────────────
//
// The input boundary of an own-mode bot, checked by BotRuntime on every turn
// (never once at spawn). The owner's Hermes runs with the owner's tool set
// and approvals, so only the owner's own words reach it:
// - only an attended, untainted wake: the owner's own message in the bot's
//   1:1 chat (wakeTaint.ts runningWakeAttended). Schedules, routines,
//   handoffs, mentions, facts and the Run button carry no owner message and
//   are refused with a room note;
// - only the bot's 1:1 chat, and only while no other bot and no guest has
//   ever written there;
// - the prompt is the owner's message alone: no room history, no system
//   prompt (AcpBrainAdapter own mode), and a leading `/` is escaped so the
//   owner's words are never a Hermes slash command (only wmux's own `/tools`
//   probe sends one).
