// ─── A merge refusal, in the owner's words ─────────────────────────────────
//
// A merge.refused fact keeps the lane's raw reason (`predicate:reason`
// codes joined by ", ", an executor code such as `lane-paused`, or
// `repro-origin: …`): bots read it as data. The room card shows the owner
// one plain sentence per cause, never the raw code.
// The card is written here in main, so the desktop room, the Bots page and
// the phone's room view read the same text. A code this table does not know
// is shown as the code. A sentence names the PR's host ({host}): GitLab for a
// GitLab repo key, GitHub otherwise.
