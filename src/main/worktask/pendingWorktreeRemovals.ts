// ─── Task worktree removals that have not finished (#2388) ─────────────────
//
// A task close records its worktree here before anything is stopped or
// removed, and forgets it once the folder is gone. When `git worktree remove`
// drops the worktree's record but leaves part of the folder (a file still
// held open on Windows) and the leftover could not be finished at once, the
// record is what is left: the folder is no longer a worktree, so the task's
// next close could not tell which repository it came from and would close the
// task around it. With the record, that close (and the sweep at start,
// TaskWorktreeManager.finishPendingRemoval) finishes the removal under the
// same checks as the first attempt. Persisted as
// `<wmuxDir>/worktask/pending-removals.json`.
