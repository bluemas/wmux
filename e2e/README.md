# Electron e2e

`npm run test:e2e` builds the app (`build:daemon`, `build:mcp`, then
`e2e/build.mjs`, which runs forge's own Vite config generator without
packaging) and runs `e2e/*.e2e.test.mjs` with node's test runner. On Linux
without a display it wraps the run in `xvfb-run`. It is not part of `npm test`
or vitest.

- **Isolated**: each run gets a fresh `HOME` under the temp dir and
  `WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX=-e2e`, so it never touches a real wmux, and it kills its
  own app, daemon and ptys afterwards (matched by `WMUX_E2E_RUN` / `HOME`).
- **No model**: `e2e/fake-bin/claude` stands in for Claude Code. As a fan-out
  worker it runs the scenario's shell script in its worktree.
- **Local remote**: the project is cloned from a bare repository in the sandbox.
- **Artifacts**: screenshots go to `e2e/artifacts/` (override with
  `WMUX_E2E_ARTIFACTS`). Set `WMUX_E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` to reuse a build and
  `WMUX_E2E_KEEP=1` to keep the sandbox HOME.
- **macOS**: the sandbox lives under `/tmp` (the per-user temp dir is too long
  for the daemon's Unix sockets), Electron's userData is pointed into the
  sandbox with `--user-data-dir`, cleanup reads `ps -E` where there is no
  `/proc`, and the app runs with `--use-mock-keychain`: the sandbox HOME has no
  login keychain, so the first safeStorage call would block the app's main
  thread on a keychain dialog (forever on a locked screen).

## First run from a packaged build

`npm run e2e:first-run -- --app <packaged wmux executable>` (for example
`out/wmux-win32-x64/wmux.exe` after `npm run package`) checks the path a new
user takes: a fresh profile opens the welcome wizard, the "Agent ready" card
shows Claude Code ready, the wizard installs the hooks, "Try sample task"
starts the agent in a pane and the wizard closes, and the sidebar lists Claude
Code at a status at rest. It is a separate script, not a `node --test` file,
because it drives an already packaged app.

- **Isolated**: a unique `WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX` and a sandbox home under the temp
  dir (`/tmp` on macOS, resolved to `/private/tmp` as the app logs it; the
  per-user temp dir is too long for the daemon's Unix sockets) (`HOME` and `CODEX_HOME`; on Windows also `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA`,
  `LOCALAPPDATA`), so the hooks install lands in the sandbox. Electron's
  userData goes into the sandbox too (`--user-data-dir`, through
  `control-wmux launch`).
  `WMUX_NO_PATH_REFRESH=1` keeps the Windows registry PATH from putting real
  agents ahead of the fakes. Preflight refuses a `--suffix` that already has
  data or a named pipe, and an `--app` under the installed wmux
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\wmux`), whose boot reconciles the real PATH, autostart and
  shortcuts. On macOS an isolated instance never installs the CLI shim.
- **MCP registration is seeded, not clicked**: agent configs are not
  per-suffix, so a suffixed instance never writes them, and the registrar uses
  Electron's own home (`app.getPath('home')`), which a sandboxed `HOME` does
  not move. The sandbox starts with a `~/.claude.json` holding the wmux entry;
  never set `WMUX_MCP_REGISTER_EXTERNAL=1` here. The run fails if app.log
  shows a registrar write outside the sandbox.
- **No model**: `scripts/fixtures/fake-agents/claude.mjs` and `codex.mjs` come
  first on PATH (`claude.cmd` + `claude.js` on Windows, a shell script
  elsewhere). They answer `--version` (9.9.9) and the sign-in status probes as
  signed in; the scenario fails if the ready card shows any other version.
  A sandbox `~/.zprofile` puts the fakes back in front after macOS's
  `/etc/zprofile` (path_helper) reorders PATH in the `zsh -l` pane. Before
  "Try sample task", the run asks the active pane, through the packaged CLI,
  which `claude` its shell resolves (`command -v`, or `Get-Command` in
  PowerShell) and stops unless it is the fake: a real Claude Code would spend
  the owner's account.
- **Driver**: every UI step goes through `scripts/control-wmux.mjs` with
  `data-testid` handles, with its state and evidence in the run's folder
  (`CONTROL_WMUX_DIR`).
- **Teardown** runs on every exit. Its two roots are pinned as pid and
  creation time: the app when control-wmux spawns it, the daemon when it is
  first tied to the app (its child, or on POSIX a process whose environment
  carries the run's suffix). A tree is expanded only from a root that still
  matches, so a pid reused after an early exit is never recorded. Then
  `control-wmux stop --purge`, only while the recorded app is alive; then any
  recorded process still alive (same pid and creation time, re-checked right
  before each kill; on Windows checked and killed through one pinned process
  handle, never a bare pid) is killed and fails the run; on macOS a finished
  launchd job labelled for the suffix is booted out (a running one fails the
  run); then the sandbox is deleted.
  Suffixed data outside the sandbox that appeared during the run is deleted
  and fails the run; data that existed before is never touched.
  `result.json` lists the pinned identities and every kill.
- **Artifacts**: `e2e/artifacts/first-run/<time><suffix>/` (override with
  `--artifacts` or `WMUX_E2E_ARTIFACTS`): `result.json` (steps, timings,
  teardown check), `fake-agents.jsonl`, and under `evidence/` app.log plus,
  on failure, a screenshot, an ARIA snapshot, doctor.json and the daemon logs.
  `--keep` keeps the sandbox home.
- Exit 0 on pass; otherwise 1 and one line,
  `first-run e2e: FAIL at <step>: <reason>`.

## Scenarios

- `fanout-cost.e2e.test.mjs` — the fan-out cost baseline (PRD E0 R0-2). An
  ordinary agent pane fans out three tasks and follows them to
  `review_requested`. `fanout-parent.mjs` plays that parent inside the pane
  through the real MCP bundle (`mcpClient.mjs`), and `fanout-worker.mjs`
  reports for each fake worker. It prints MCP calls, characters received
  (total and worker-written) and nudges, and saves them to
  `e2e/artifacts/fanout-cost.json`. The parent does only what the product
  tells it to, so the counts are lower bounds for a real agent. After one
  build, `node --test e2e/fanout-cost.e2e.test.mjs` runs it alone.
